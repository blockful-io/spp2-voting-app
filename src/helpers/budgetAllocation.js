 * 1. SPP1 projects can get 2-year streams with extended budget
 * 2. Any remaining 2-year budget transfers to 1-year stream
 * 3. Other projects can get 1-year streams with extended budget
 * 4. If extended budget doesn't fit, try basic budget
 * 5. "None Below" candidate is included in ranking but not allocated budget
 * 
 * @param {Array} projects - Ranked list of service provider projects
