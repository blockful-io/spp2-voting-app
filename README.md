# SPP2 Voting App - Copeland Ranking System

## Overview

This application implements a Service Provider Program (SPP) allocation system using the Copeland method for ranked choice voting. It processes voting data from Snapshot, ranks candidates, and allocates budgets based on configurable rules.

## Features

- Processes ranked choice voting data from Snapshot or CSV files
- Implements the Copeland method for fair candidate ranking
- Allocates budgets according to program-specific rules
- Handles special "None Below" voting marker
- Generates detailed reports of allocation results
- Provides head-to-head comparison data for all candidates
- Parses service provider names and budget types from choice options
- Supports bidimensional voting with automatic grouping of related choices

## Algorithm: The Copeland Method

The Copeland method is a rank-determination algorithm that works as follows:

1. **Pairwise Comparisons**: Each candidate is compared head-to-head with every other candidate.
2. **Voting Mechanism**:

   - For each pair of candidates (A, B), we count how much voting power ranked A above B.
   - "None Below" option serves as a special marker - any candidate ranked below it is considered unranked.
   - Ranked candidates always beat unranked candidates in head-to-head contests.
   - No votes are counted between two unranked candidates.

3. **Scoring**:

   - A candidate receives 1 point for each head-to-head matchup they win.
   - No points are awarded for losses or ties.
   - Total points determine the final ranking.
   - In case of equal points, average support percentage is used as a tiebreaker.

4. **Budget Allocation**:

   - Candidates are processed in ranking order
   - SPP1 projects can receive 2-year funding streams
   - Remaining projects are allocated 1-year funding streams
   - Extended budgets are attempted first, falling back to basic budgets if necessary
   - Any remaining 2-year stream budget is transferred to the 1-year stream

5. **Bidimensional Voting** (when enabled):
   - Service providers with multiple budget options (basic/extended) are treated as related
   - In each voter's ranking, all options from the same provider are grouped together
   - The highest-ranked option determines the position for all related options
   - This ensures that voters cannot rank different budget options from the same provider in arbitrary positions

## Usage

### Configuration

Edit `src/helpers/config.js` to set your specific parameters:

```javascript
// Budget parameters
const PROGRAM_BUDGET = 4500000; // Total budget in USD per year
const TWO_YEAR_STREAM_RATIO = 1 / 3; // Proportion allocated to 2-year streams
const ONE_YEAR_STREAM_RATIO = 2 / 3; // Proportion allocated to 1-year stream

// Data source configuration
const USE_LOCAL_DATA = true; // Set to false to use Snapshot API
const USE_CSV_DATA = true; // Use CSV files for service provider data

// Feature flags
const BIDIMENSIONAL_ENABLED = true; // Group choices from the same provider in voting ranks

// Snapshot proposal ID
const PROPOSAL_ID =
  "0xbbf155b669bcc99133148320ca7876d8bb53a870cd9b7f9ec51b8db29cd7a0f8";
```

### CSV Data Format

Place your CSV files in the `src/helpers/data` directory:

1. **choices.csv**: Contains service provider data

   ```
   choiceId,choiceName,budgetAmount,isSpp
   1,sp a,400000,FALSE
   2,sp b - basic,400000,TRUE
   3,sp b - ext,500000,FALSE
   4,sp c,700000,TRUE
   5,None below,0,FALSE
   ```

2. **votes.csv**: Contains voting data
   ```
   Name,Votes,Choice 1,Choice 2,Choice 3,Choice 4,Choice 5
   0xAddress1,1.00,Provider A,Provider B,Provider C,None Below,Provider D

## CSV Format

### choices.csv

The choices.csv file contains service provider data with the following columns:

```
choiceId,choiceName,budgetAmount,isSpp
1,sp a,400000,FALSE
2,sp b - basic,400000,TRUE
3,sp b - ext,500000,FALSE
